# Introduction

ConvLSTM architecture is developed from scratch by following the proposed framework in [Convolutional LSTM Network: A Machine Learning Approach for Precipitation Nowcasting](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04214). The project details will be added when initial successful results are available.
